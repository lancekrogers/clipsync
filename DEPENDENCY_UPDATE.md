## Build Status

Due to permission issues with the target directory (owned by root), a full build test could not be completed. Before making the repository public, you should:

1. Clean the target directory: `sudo rm -rf target`
2. Run a full build: `cargo build --release`
3. Run tests: `cargo test`
4. Check for any deprecation warnings: `cargo clippy`

## Security Notes

These updates include various security patches and bug fixes. Running `cargo audit` after a successful build is recommended to verify no known vulnerabilities remain.
