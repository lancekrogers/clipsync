# Critical Security Fixes Applied

## Overview
Fixed critical security issues that were causing system authentication problems and potential password leakage.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **File Descriptor Manipulation (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: The daemon was improperly redirecting stdin/stdout/stderr to `/dev/null` without properly detaching from the terminal, causing password prompts to fail.

**Fix**: 
- Rewrote `daemon.rs` to use proper daemonization sequence
- Added proper `setsid()` call to detach from terminal
- Close file descriptors AFTER detaching from terminal
- Added `--foreground` mode to avoid daemonization entirely
- Added systemd service template for safer operation

### 2. ✅ **Aggressive Clipboard Monitoring**
**Problem**: Polling clipboard every 200ms could interfere with password managers and cause excessive CPU usage.

**Fix**:
- Changed polling interval from 200ms to 1 second
- Reduced CPU usage and system interference

### 3. ✅ **Sensitive Data Protection**
**Problem**: No checks to prevent syncing passwords, SSH keys, or API tokens.

**Fix**: Added `clipboard/safety.rs` module that:
- Detects password patterns
- Detects SSH keys and API tokens
- Detects high-entropy data (likely encrypted)
- Skips sync when in sudo context
- Prevents accidental password/secret leakage

### 4. ✅ **Signal Handling**
**Problem**: Using wrong signal (SIGCONT instead of signal 0) for process checking.

**Fix**: 
- Changed to use `signal::kill(pid, None)` for process checking
- This is the proper way to check if a process exists

## Safe Usage Guidelines

### Recommended: Use Foreground Mode
```bash
# Safe way to run (stays in foreground)
clipsync start --foreground

# Or use systemd (even safer)
systemctl --user start clipsync
```

### If You Must Use Daemon Mode
```bash
# Only after thorough testing
clipsync start

# Always check status
clipsync status

# Stop immediately if issues occur
clipsync stop
```

### Testing Safely
1. Use the sandboxing scripts in `/scripts/`
2. Run in a container or VM first
3. Test with non-sensitive data
4. Monitor system logs: `journalctl -f`

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't run as root or with sudo
- ❌ Don't run the old version of the code
- ❌ Don't ignore error messages
- ❌ Don't sync sensitive data without encryption

## Verification
Before running in production:
```bash
# Check the daemon code was updated
grep -n "run_foreground" src/daemon.rs

# Check clipboard monitoring interval
grep -n "Duration::from_secs(1)" src/sync/mod.rs

# Check safety module exists
ls src/clipboard/safety.rs

# Build and test
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Emergency Recovery
If authentication issues occur again:
1. `pkill -9 clipsync`
2. `rm ~/.local/run/clipsync.pid`
3. Boot to recovery mode if needed
4. Reset password with `passwd` command

**These fixes prevent the clipboard sync tool from interfering with system authentication and protect sensitive data from being accidentally synchronized.**
