# Sprint 1 - Agent 3: Data Layer Specialist

## Your Mission
You are a Rust database and cryptography specialist responsible for implementing the secure clipboard history system for ClipSync. You will complete task 06 from the task list, focusing on encrypted storage and key management.

## Context
ClipSync is a clipboard synchronization service that:
- Syncs clipboard content between macOS and Linux (X11/Wayland) in real-time
- Supports payloads up to 5MB (text, RTF, images)
- **Maintains a 20-item encrypted history** (your focus)
- Uses SSH keys for authentication (separate from history encryption)
- Written in Rust for performance and safety

## Prerequisites
Wait for Agent 1 to complete the project setup, or create a minimal structure:
```
src/
├── lib.rs
├── history/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── database.rs
│   └── encryption.rs
```

## Your Task

### Task 6: History Database Module
Reference: `@ai_docs/task/06_history_database.md` and `@ai_docs/ClipSync_Spec.md` (Database Schema section)

#### Part 1: Database Implementation (`src/history/database.rs`)

Implement SQLite database with:
```sql
CREATE TABLE clipboard_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    uuid TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    content BLOB NOT NULL,          -- AES-256-GCM encrypted
    content_type TEXT NOT NULL,     -- text/plain, text/rtf, image/png
    content_size INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Original size before encryption
    checksum TEXT NOT NULL,         -- SHA-256 of plaintext
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- Unix timestamp
    origin_node TEXT NOT NULL,      -- Node UUID that created this
    iv BLOB NOT NULL,               -- AES initialization vector
    created_at INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now'))
);
```

Key requirements:
- Automatic 20-item limit via trigger
- Indexes on timestamp and content_type
- Compression for entries > 100KB
- Migration system for schema updates

#### Part 2: Encryption Module (`src/history/encryption.rs`)

Implement AES-256-GCM encryption with three-tier key management:

1. **Primary: System Keyring**
   ```rust
   keyring::Entry::new("clipsync", "history_key")
   ```

2. **Fallback: SSH-encrypted key file**
   ```rust
   // Generate AES key on first run
   let aes_key = rand::random::<[u8; 32]>();
   // Encrypt with user's SSH public key
   let encrypted = ssh_pubkey.encrypt(&aes_key);
   fs::write("~/.config/clipsync/history.key", encrypted);
   ```

3. **Last Resort: Password derivation**
   ```rust
   argon2::hash_password(passphrase, salt, 32)
   ```

#### Part 3: History Operations (`src/history/mod.rs`)

Public API for history management:
```rust
pub struct ClipboardHistory {
    db: HistoryDatabase,
    encryptor: Encryptor,
}

impl ClipboardHistory {
    pub async fn new(db_path: &Path) -> Result<Self>;
    pub async fn add(&self, content: &ClipboardContent) -> Result<()>;
    pub async fn get_recent(&self, count: usize) -> Result<Vec<HistoryEntry>>;
    pub async fn get_by_index(&self, index: u8) -> Result<HistoryEntry>;
    pub async fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<HistoryEntry>>;
    pub async fn clear(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## Requirements

### Security
- Use `zeroize` for sensitive data cleanup
- Never log encryption keys or decrypted content
- Validate checksums on decryption
- Use secure random IVs for each entry
- Clear memory after use

### Performance
- Lazy decryption (only when accessed)
- Compress before encryption for large items
- Batch operations where possible
- Connection pooling for concurrent access

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of corrupted entries
- Key unavailability recovery
- Database lock timeouts
- Migration failure recovery

### Testing
Create comprehensive tests:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Test encryption/decryption roundtrip
    #[test]
    fn test_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip() { }
    
    // Test 20-item limit enforcement
    #[test]
    fn test_history_limit() { }
    
    // Test key management fallbacks
    #[test]
    fn test_key_management_tiers() { }
    
    // Test large payload handling
    #[test]
    fn test_large_payload_compression() { }
    
    // Benchmark encryption performance
    #[bench]
    fn bench_encrypt_5mb_payload(b: &mut Bencher) { }
}
```

### Integration Points
Your module will be used by:
- Sync Engine: Stores all clipboard changes
- CLI: Retrieves history for display
- Hotkey handler: Quick access to recent items

Ensure your APIs:
- Handle concurrent access safely
- Provide async interfaces
- Support streaming for large items
- Are mockable for testing

## Success Criteria
1. Database:
   - Creates and migrates successfully
   - 20-item limit works automatically
   - Indexes improve query performance
   - Handles corruption gracefully

2. Encryption:
   - All three key storage methods work
   - No plaintext ever hits disk
   - Performance < 50ms for 1MB items
   - Memory is zeroed after use

3. API:
   - Intuitive and safe to use
   - Async/await throughout
   - Proper error types
   - Well documented

## Implementation Tips

### Database
- Use `rusqlite` with `bundled-sqlcipher` feature
- Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
- Use prepared statements
- Handle busy timeouts

### Encryption
- Generate random IV for each entry
- Include IV in AAD for authentication
- Use `aes-gcm` crate with hardware acceleration
- Benchmark different chunk sizes

### Key Management
- Try keyring first (most secure)
- Cache decrypted key in memory (with zeroize)
- Prompt for password only as last resort
- Consider key rotation strategy

## Getting Started
1. Set up test database in temp directory
2. Implement encryption module first
3. Add database schema and operations
4. Create comprehensive tests
5. Benchmark with real 5MB payloads

## Important Notes
- This is security-critical code - be paranoid
- Consider timing attacks in search
- Document security assumptions
- Plan for key rotation/recovery

Remember: You're protecting users' clipboard history. Security and reliability are paramount!
