# Sprint 1 - Agent 1: Project Setup Specialist

## Your Mission
You are a Rust project setup specialist responsible for creating the foundation of ClipSync, a cross-platform clipboard synchronization tool. You will complete tasks 01, 02, and 03 from the task list.

## Context
ClipSync is a clipboard synchronization service that:
- Syncs clipboard content between macOS and Linux (X11/Wayland) in real-time
- Supports payloads up to 5MB (text, RTF, images)
- Maintains a 20-item encrypted history
- Uses SSH keys for authentication
- Written in Rust for performance and safety

## Your Tasks

### Task 1: Project Scaffolding
Reference: `@ai_docs/task/01_project_scaffolding.md`
- Create the complete directory structure
- Set up .gitignore, .editorconfig
- Create placeholder README.md and LICENSE
- Initialize git repository

### Task 2: Rust Project Setup  
Reference: `@ai_docs/task/02_rust_setup.md`
- Initialize Cargo project
- Add all dependencies to Cargo.toml
- Create rust-toolchain.toml
- Set up .cargo/config.toml for cross-platform builds
- Create skeleton src/main.rs and src/lib.rs

### Task 3: Build System
Reference: `@ai_docs/task/03_build_system.md`
- Create comprehensive Makefile
- Create justfile for developer convenience
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Create service files (systemd/launchd)

## Requirements

### Code Quality
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Use proper error handling (thiserror/anyhow)
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Ensure all code passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`

### Testing
- Create a simple test to verify project builds
- Add GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every commit
- Ensure cross-compilation works for all targets

### Integration Points
Your output will be used by:
- Agent 2: Needs the module structure in src/
- Agent 3: Needs the project structure for database module
- Both agents need working Cargo.toml with dependencies

## Success Criteria
1. Project structure matches specification exactly
2. `cargo build` succeeds without warnings
3. `cargo test` runs (even if just dummy tests)
4. `make` and `just` commands work correctly
5. GitHub Actions CI passes
6. Cross-compilation targets work:
   - x86_64-apple-darwin
   - aarch64-apple-darwin  
   - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   - aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

## Getting Started
1. Create the project directory: `mkdir -p clip_board_sync && cd clip_board_sync`
2. Follow tasks 01, 02, 03 in order
3. Commit your work with clear messages
4. Test everything thoroughly
5. Document any deviations or improvements

## STATUS: COMPLETED ✅

All tasks have been successfully completed:

### Task 1: Project Scaffolding ✅
- Created complete directory structure
- Set up .gitignore, .editorconfig
- Created README.md and dual licenses (MIT + Apache-2.0)
- Git repository initialized

### Task 2: Rust Setup ✅
- Cargo project initialized as "clipsync"
- All dependencies added to Cargo.toml
- Created rust-toolchain.toml
- Set up .cargo/config.toml
- Created skeleton src/main.rs and src/lib.rs
- Created mod.rs files for all modules

### Task 3: Build System ✅
- Created comprehensive Makefile with cross-platform support
- Created justfile for developer convenience
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Created service files (systemd/launchd)

### Additional Work
- Created SETUP_NOTES.md documenting the setup process
- Fixed configuration module to work without validator crate
- Set up proper module structure for other agents

The foundation is ready for Agents 2 and 3 to build upon.

## Important Notes
- This is the foundation - other agents depend on your work
- Focus on correctness over optimization at this stage
- If you encounter platform-specific issues, document them
- Create a SETUP_NOTES.md if you have important observations

Remember: You're building the foundation that the entire project will rest on. Take time to get it right!
