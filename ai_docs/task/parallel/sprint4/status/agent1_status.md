# Agent 1 Status: Packaging & Installation Specialist

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks

1. **Directory Structure** ✅
   - Created complete `pkg/` directory hierarchy
   - Organized by platform (macos, debian, rpm, homebrew, aur)

2. **macOS Packaging** ✅
   - Info.plist with proper bundle configuration
   - distribution.xml for installer flow
   - Welcome/readme/conclusion RTF resources
   - entitlements.plist for code signing
   - Full launchd service integration

3. **Linux Packaging** ✅
   - Debian control file with dependencies
   - Post-install/pre-remove scripts
   - RPM spec file with systemd integration
   - AUR PKGBUILD for Arch Linux
   - systemd user service file

4. **Universal Installer** ✅
   - Auto-detects OS and architecture
   - Downloads from GitHub releases
   - Installs service files automatically
   - Creates config/data directories
   - Works on macOS and Linux

5. **Build Automation** ✅
   - `build-macos.sh` - Creates pkg and dmg files
   - `build-linux.sh` - Creates deb, rpm, tarball, AppImage
   - `build-all.sh` - Orchestrates all builds
   - Cross-compilation support documented

6. **Package Management** ✅
   - Homebrew formula with service support
   - Service management for all platforms
   - Proper file permissions and paths
   - Clean uninstall procedures

### Integration Points

1. **For Agent 2 (Documentation)**:
   - Install command: `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash`
   - Homebrew: `brew install clipsync`
   - Service commands documented in scripts
   - Package formats: pkg, dmg, deb, rpm, tar.gz

2. **For Agent 3 (CI/CD)**:
   - Build scripts ready for GitHub Actions
   - Output artifacts in `build/` and `dist/`
   - SHA256 checksums generated
   - Cross-compilation setup documented

### Notes for Other Agents

- All package files use placeholder URLs (yourusername/clipsync)
- SHA256 hashes marked as PLACEHOLDER
- Code signing documented but requires certificates
- Service files already exist in `scripts/` directory
- Binary path standardized to `/usr/local/bin/clipsync`

### Testing Instructions

1. Build packages:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/package/build-all.sh
   ```

2. Test installer:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

3. Platform-specific tests:
   - macOS: Open .pkg or .dmg file
   - Debian: `sudo dpkg -i *.deb`
   - RedHat: `sudo rpm -i *.rpm`
   - Arch: `makepkg -si` in pkg/aur/

### No Blockers

All packaging infrastructure is complete and ready for integration with CI/CD pipelines. The build scripts are designed to work both locally and in automated environments.
